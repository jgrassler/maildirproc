several existing mail boxes in the maildir format. It is primarily \
focused on mail sorting -- i.e., moving, copying, forwarding and \
deleting mail according to a set of rules. It can be seen as an \
alternative to procmail, but instead of being a delivery agent \
(which wants to be part of the delivery chain), maildirproc only \
processes already delivered mail. And that's a feature, not a \
bug.""",
